# Mirror Neurons - What did i just do?
This is a python implementation of Bonaiuto and Arbib's scientific paper 
[Extending the mirror neuron system model, II: what did I just do? A new role for mirror neurons.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20217428)

It is an attempt to reproduce the results for teaching purposes.
## How to run
### Requirements
Requires **python 2.7+**.
Additional libraries can be install through pip, using


  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Run
To start the simulation, execute the main code

  ```python main.py```

## Sample Results
### With mirror system
![desirability per action](../master/images/ms_desirabilities.png)

![trial length](../master/images/ms_lengths.png)
### Without mirror system
![desirability per action](../master/images/no_ms_desirabilities.png)

![trial length](../master/images/no_ms_lengths.png)
